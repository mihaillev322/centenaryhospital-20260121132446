                        <h3>Where is Centenary Hospital located and what are the main entrances?</h3>
                        <p>Centenary Hospital is conveniently located in Canada with multiple accessible entrances designed for patient convenience and safety. The main entrance provides direct access to our registration desk, information services, and elevator access to all floors including outpatient clinics and diagnostic services. The emergency entrance is clearly marked with prominent signage and is available 24/7 for urgent medical situations. We also have a dedicated ambulance entrance for emergency medical services. All entrances are wheelchair accessible and equipped with automatic doors. Parking is available near all entrances with designated accessible parking spaces close to each entry point.</p>

                        <h3>What are the Emergency Department hours and when should I go to the ER versus a clinic?</h3>
                        <p>Our Emergency Department operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, staffed with experienced emergency physicians and nurses. Visit the ER immediately for life-threatening conditions such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe injuries, suspected stroke, severe allergic reactions, or serious accidents. For non-urgent medical concerns like minor cuts, cold symptoms, routine check-ups, prescription refills, or minor sprains, our walk-in clinic (open 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM daily) is more appropriate and typically has shorter wait times. If you're unsure about the severity of your condition, don't hesitate to call our triage nurse or visit the ER - we're here to help determine the best course of care.</p>

                        <h3>How can I check or estimate emergency room wait times at Centenary Hospital?</h3>
                        <p>While exact wait times can vary based on patient volume and the severity of cases, we provide estimated wait times through several channels. You can call our main hospital number to speak with our information desk for current ER wait time estimates. Wait times in the emergency department are determined by medical urgency, not arrival time - patients with more serious conditions are seen first regardless of when they arrived. Typical wait times for non-urgent cases range from 2-6 hours, while urgent cases are seen immediately. We recommend bringing entertainment, snacks, and any necessary medications if you anticipate a longer wait. Our staff will keep you informed about delays and provide updates on your expected wait time.</p>

                        <h3>Do I need a referral from a family doctor to see a specialist at Centenary Hospital?</h3>
                        <p>For most specialist appointments at Centenary Hospital, you will need a referral from your family doctor or another physician. This referral system ensures that you receive the most appropriate specialist care and helps coordinate your treatment plan. Your family doctor will assess your condition and determine which specialist would best address your needs, then provide a written referral with relevant medical information. However, some services like emergency care, walk-in clinic visits, and certain diagnostic tests may not require referrals. If you don't have a family doctor, our walk-in clinic physicians can provide referrals when medically necessary. The referral process typically takes 1-2 weeks to process, and our referral coordinators will contact you to schedule your specialist appointment.</p>

                        <h3>How do I book, change, or cancel an appointment for a clinic or outpatient service?</h3>
                        <p>Booking appointments at Centenary Hospital is convenient and flexible. For new appointments, call our central booking line during business hours (8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday through Friday). Have your health card, referral (if required), and preferred appointment times ready. To change or cancel existing appointments, call at least 24 hours in advance to avoid cancellation fees and allow other patients to use the appointment slot. When booking, please inform us of any special needs such as wheelchair accessibility, interpreter services, or specific scheduling requirements. For urgent appointments, we maintain same-day and next-day slots for priority cases. Our booking staff will provide you with pre-appointment instructions, parking information, and directions to the appropriate department.</p>

                        <h3>What should I bring to my appointment (health card, ID, medication list) in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>To ensure a smooth appointment experience, please bring your valid provincial health card and a government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport. Bring a complete list of all current medications including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements - include dosages and frequency. If you have previous test results, X-rays, or medical records relevant to your visit, bring copies with you. For specialist appointments, bring your referral letter and any insurance information if applicable. Consider bringing a list of questions you want to ask your healthcare provider, and if needed, bring a family member or friend for support. Arrive 15-30 minutes early for registration and to complete any necessary paperwork. Don't forget to bring any medical devices you use regularly, such as inhalers or glucose monitors.</p>

                        <h3>Are diagnostic imaging services (X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI) available, and how do I prepare?</h3>
                        <p>Centenary Hospital offers comprehensive diagnostic imaging services including X-ray, ultrasound, CT scans, and MRI, available 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily. Most imaging services require a physician's requisition or referral. Preparation varies by exam type: X-rays typically require no preparation, while CT scans may require fasting or contrast material. MRI appointments require removal of all metal objects and completion of a safety questionnaire. Ultrasound preparation depends on the body area being examined - some require a full bladder or fasting. Our booking staff will provide specific preparation instructions when you schedule your appointment. Results are typically available within 24-48 hours and will be sent to your referring physician. If you have claustrophobia, kidney problems, or are pregnant, inform our staff when booking as special accommodations or alternative imaging methods may be recommended.</p>

                        <h3>How do I access my medical records or request copies of test results and reports?</h3>
                        <p>Accessing your medical records at Centenary Hospital is straightforward and secure. Visit our Health Information Management department during business hours with valid photo ID and your health card to request copies of your medical records, test results, or diagnostic reports. Complete a medical records request form specifying which records you need and the date range. There may be a nominal fee for copying services, especially for large volumes of records. Most test results are available within 24-48 hours of completion and are automatically sent to your referring physician. For urgent results, contact your doctor's office directly. You have the legal right to access your complete medical record under Canadian privacy legislation. Digital copies can be provided on CD or USB drive upon request. Allow 5-10 business days for processing complex record requests, though routine test results are often available immediately.</p>

                        <h3>What are the visiting hours and visitor policies (including children and infection control)?</h3>
                        <p>Visiting hours at Centenary Hospital are 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily, though these may be adjusted based on patient needs and department-specific requirements. All visitors must check in at the information desk and may be required to show ID and complete a health screening questionnaire. During flu season or infection control situations, visiting may be restricted to immediate family members only. Children under 12 must be supervised by an adult at all times and may be restricted from certain areas during infection outbreaks. We limit the number of visitors per patient to ensure comfort and safety - typically 2-3 visitors at a time. Visitors showing signs of illness (fever, cough, cold symptoms) should not visit to protect patients and staff. Special accommodations can be made for end-of-life situations or pediatric patients. All visitors must follow hand hygiene protocols and may be required to wear masks or other protective equipment depending on current health guidelines.</p>

                        <h3>Is parking available on-site, what are the rates, and are accessible parking spots provided?</h3>
                        <p>Centenary Hospital provides convenient on-site parking with multiple lots and a multi-level parking structure. Parking rates are competitive and designed to accommodate both short-term visits and longer stays. Hourly rates typically range from $2-4 per hour, with daily maximum rates around $15-20.

                        <h3>What services are covered by provincial health insurance, and what might have out-of-pocket costs?</h3>
                        <p>Most essential medical services at Centenary Hospital are covered by provincial health insurance plans across Canada, including emergency care, physician consultations, diagnostic tests, and medically necessary procedures. Services typically covered include ER visits, walk-in clinic consultations, X-rays, blood tests, CT scans, MRI when medically necessary, and inpatient care. However, some services may have out-of-pocket costs including private or semi-private room upgrades, certain elective procedures, cosmetic treatments, and some specialized diagnostic tests not deemed medically necessary. Prescription medications, medical devices, and some rehabilitation services may require additional insurance or payment. International visitors and those without valid provincial health coverage will be responsible for all costs. We recommend checking with your provincial health authority and private insurance provider to understand your specific coverage. Our financial counselors can help explain costs and payment options for any services not covered by provincial insurance.</p>
